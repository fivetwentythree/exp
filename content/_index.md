Let's be honest: most classical philosophy is presented as if it were a user agreement for software you'll never use. It's dense, dry, and you're tempted to just scroll to the bottom and click "I Agree" without reading a word.

But what if those texts aren't dusty relics? What if they're actually a series of surprisingly sharp, funny, and ruthless strategy memos from the original consultants who built Western civilization?

This project is an experiment in testing that theory. Here, we treat thinkers like [Machiavelli](/posts/discourses-on-livy), [Aristotle](/posts/nicomachean-ethics), and [Tocqueville](/posts/democracy-america) not as historical artifacts, but as the senior partners at a very, very old firm. They have some... unconventional ideas about management, risk, and how to keep your colleagues from murdering you over market share (or, you know, political power).

So, welcome. Let's see what we can learn.
