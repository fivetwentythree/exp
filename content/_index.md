### About Me

I spent my days turning chromatograms into cash flow and my nights turning spreadsheets into rent checks. The lab taught me that a well-tuned HPLC column is really just a tiny factory for separating noise from signal, the real estate taught me that same principle applies to cash-on-cash returns. Now I'm teaching Python to do both at once, which turns out to be the same thing as teaching it to find money that other people can't see.

here is my [CV](/personal/cv.pdf)

Here are some of my ideas on [Machiavelli](/posts/discourses-on-livy), [Aristotle](/posts/nicomachean-ethics) and [Tocqueville](/posts/democracy-america).
