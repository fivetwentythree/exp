- The treasure is where you started - We circle the world seeking what was always within
- The universe conspires to help you - When you commit to your path, all existence becomes your ally
- Fear of suffering is worse than suffering itself - The dread imprisons; the reality liberates
- The journey IS the destination - What you seek changes you into someone capable of finding it
- Everything is written in the Language of the World - Learn to read the omens; they're everywhere
- When you want something, all the universe conspires - Desire aligned with purpose moves mountains
- Wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure - Follow what makes you come alive
