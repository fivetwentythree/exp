- The only thing you control is your mind. External events are out of your hands, but your response to them is entirely yours. This is the core of the "inner citadel."
- Live according to nature, which means living according to reason. Don't be swayed by irrational passions.
- The obstacle is the way. What stands in your way becomes the path forward.
- Think of the shortness of life. Don't waste time on trivialities or the opinions of others. Memento mori.
