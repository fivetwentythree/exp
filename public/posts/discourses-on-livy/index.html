<h2 id="the-context-thing">The Context Thing</h2>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a fun story about Niccolò Machiavelli. Everyone knows him as the &ldquo;ends justify the means&rdquo; guy who wrote <em>The Prince</em>, that cynical handbook about how to be a ruthless dictator. But here&rsquo;s the thing: Machiavelli actually preferred republics! I know! The guy whose name literally became an adjective for scheming political manipulation spent most of his intellectual energy writing a massive love letter to republican government. It&rsquo;s like finding out that Gordon Gekko&rsquo;s favorite book was actually about credit unions.</p>
<p>The book is called <em>Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy</em>, which, okay, is not exactly a beach read title. Machiavelli wrote it between 1513 and 1519, roughly the same time as <em>The Prince</em>, but the circumstances matter here. See, Machiavelli had what we in the finance industry call a &ldquo;career event.&rdquo; In 1512, the Medici family rolled back into Florence after the republican government collapsed, and Machiavelli – who&rsquo;d been Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence, basically a senior bureaucrat and diplomat – was immediately:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fired</li>
<li>Exiled</li>
<li>Tortured (they used something called the strappado, which I will not describe)</li>
<li>Eventually released to his farm to write angry books</li>
</ol>
<p>This is sub-optimal career progression.</p>
<h2 id="the-unemployed-guy-writing-about-management">The Unemployed Guy Writing About Management</h2>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Machiavelli, sitting on his farm, professionally destroyed, personally humiliated, and what does he do? He writes TWO books about politics. It&rsquo;s like getting fired from Goldman Sachs and immediately starting a Substack about optimal banking regulation.</p>
<p><em>The Prince</em> was his job application – dedicated to Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, essentially saying &ldquo;hey, I know you guys tortured me, but I&rsquo;m really good at this politics stuff, maybe hire me?&rdquo; (Spoiler: they didn&rsquo;t.) But the <em>Discourses</em> was different. This was Machiavelli writing for his friends, for posterity, for the sheer intellectual pleasure of figuring out how republics actually work.</p>
<p>The structure is delightfully weird. Livy was a Roman historian who wrote about the early Roman Republic, and Machiavelli uses Livy&rsquo;s history as a jumping-off point to talk about&hellip; everything. It&rsquo;s like if someone today wrote a book called &ldquo;Thoughts on Reading Michael Lewis&rdquo; and used it to explain their entire theory of financial markets. Actually, that&rsquo;s not a bad idea.</p>
<h2 id="the-republican-machine">The Republican Machine</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Machiavelli figured out, and it&rsquo;s kind of brilliant: republics are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)">antifragile</a> (to use Nassim Taleb&rsquo;s word, which Machiavelli would have loved).</p>
<p>The basic Machiavellian insight about republics goes like this: You know how in <em>The Prince</em> he says rulers need to be feared rather than loved? Well, in republics, the whole system runs on controlled conflict. You&rsquo;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nobles (who want to oppress everyone)</li>
<li>The people (who want not to be oppressed)</li>
<li>Some kind of institutional structure that lets them fight it out without actually killing each other</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s like checks and balances, but messier and more honest about human nature. Machiavelli looks at Rome and says: &ldquo;These guys were constantly having internal conflicts between patricians and plebeians, and that&rsquo;s WHY they succeeded, not despite it.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/anc-conflict-of-the-orders-reading/?srsltid=AfmBOorfPhbn1DorhVCrgu-mZbEDhU0NqkDZFypa_fGheiVJB13snlx0"></a></p>
<p>This is counterintuitive! The conventional wisdom in Machiavelli&rsquo;s time (and honestly, in our time too) is that you want unity, harmony, everyone pulling in the same direction. Machiavelli is like: &ldquo;No, no, no – you want productive tension. You want the investment bankers and the regulators to be in permanent conflict, because that&rsquo;s how you get a system that actually works.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-startup-founders-guide-to-ancient-rome">The Startup Founder&rsquo;s Guide to Ancient Rome</h2>
<p>What makes the <em>Discourses</em> fascinating is that Machiavelli treats Rome like a case study at Harvard Business School. He&rsquo;s constantly asking practical questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you set up institutions that channel ambition productively?</li>
<li>What do you do when your republic gets too successful and rich? (Spoiler: it&rsquo;s bad)</li>
<li>How do you prevent some charismatic strongman from taking over?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the optimal amount of inequality? (Some, but not too much)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the kicker: unlike <em>The Prince</em>, where Machiavelli is explaining how one person can gain and keep power, the <em>Discourses</em> is about how to build systems that don&rsquo;t depend on one person being good at their job. It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;how to be a successful day trader&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to build a functioning stock market.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-fortune-thing">The Fortune Thing</h2>
<p>Machiavelli has this whole riff about Fortune (which he personifies as a woman, because 16th century) that&rsquo;s way more sophisticated in the <em>Discourses</em> than in <em>The Prince</em>. In <em>The Prince</em>, Fortune controls half of everything and you just have to be bold and grab her. Very trading-floor energy.</p>
<p><img
    src="http://localhost:1313/exp/images/swot.webp"
    alt=""
    
/>
</p>
<p>But in the <em>Discourses</em>, he&rsquo;s like: &ldquo;Actually, good institutions can hedge against Fortune better than any individual prince.&rdquo; A republic with strong institutions, good laws, and that productive internal conflict we talked about? That&rsquo;s diversification, baby. One bad leader won&rsquo;t tank the whole system.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters-the-money-paragraph">Why This Matters (The Money Paragraph)</h2>
<p>Look, the reason people should care about the <em>Discourses</em> today isn&rsquo;t because we need another take on Roman history. It&rsquo;s because Machiavelli is asking the fundamental question: How do you build political systems that account for the fact that people are, generally speaking, the worst?</p>
<p>His answer – republics with lots of institutional conflict, checks on power, and channels for ambition – feels weirdly modern. Or maybe modern democracy feels weirdly Machiavellian. Either way, the <em>Discourses</em> is Machiavelli saying: &ldquo;Look, I told you how the sausage gets made in <em>The Prince</em>, but if you actually want good governance that lasts, you need a republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The irony is delicious. The guy whose name means &ldquo;evil schemer&rdquo; actually thought the best government was one where no single schemer could win. It&rsquo;s like if Bernie Madoff&rsquo;s secret passion project was designing better SEC regulations.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>
<p>So Machiavelli is sitting there in exile, career destroyed, probably drinking whatever the 16th-century Italian equivalent of whiskey was, and he writes two books. One (<em>The Prince</em>) makes him infamous forever as an amoral monster. The other (<em>Discourses</em>) contains his actual political philosophy: that republics are better than principalities, that conflict can be productive, and that good institutions matter more than good leaders.</p>
<p>The lesson here is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be careful which book of yours gets famous, or</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re going to get tortured and exiled anyway, you might as well write what you really think</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, maybe read the <em>Discourses</em>? It&rsquo;s actually pretty good, and way less likely to get you called Machiavellian at parties.</p>
