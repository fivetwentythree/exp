<p>Here is a paragraph of text. It can contain <strong>bold text</strong>, <em>italic text</em>, and <code>inline code</code>.</p>
<p>We are a wealthy nation, the political economist tells the poor
man, and our superfluous wealth must find employment somehow
or other. Hench the crush of high-stepping horses, the crowd of
three-hundred-guinea barouches; the flutter of costly garments rustling
in the summer air, the glitter and splendour which pervades every
object, until it seems almost as if the superfluous gold were melted
into the atmosphere, and all the female population were so many Miss
Kilmanseggs.</p>

<p>The lounger on the rails may for the moment find it almost
difficult to believe that hungry women and gaunt haggard-looking men
can have any place in the world of which this dazzling region is a
part: but he need only look backward, under the shadow of the trees, to
see poverty and crime prowling side by side in their rags.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet at the worst, the dazzle and the glitter are good for trade; and it is better that the tide of wealth should be rolling to and fro along the Lady&rsquo;s
Mile than locked in a miser&rsquo;s coffers or given in alms to professional
beggars at a church-door. Some part of the superfluous gold must pass
through the horny hands of labour before it can be transmuted into
C-springs or patent axles, Honiton lace or Spitalfields silk; and
perhaps the safest of all philosophy is that which accepts the doctrine
that &ldquo;whatever is, is right.&rdquo;</p>
